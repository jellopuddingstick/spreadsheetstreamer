# spreadsheetstreamer
This repository houses a work-in-progress implementation of a library for reading and writing spreadsheets (Excel and CSV) using a streaming, event-based API. The goal is to allow massive spreadsheets to be read and written with minimal memory consumption.

**NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, AND SHOULD NOT BE USED. NOT EVEN GUARANTEED TO COMPILE.**
